## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r load-and-clean-data, echo=FALSE}
# Load data using here::here
data <- read_csv(here("data", "raw", "strep_tb.csv"))

# Clean data
modified_data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    baseline_condition = factor(baseline_condition, labels = c("Good", "Fair", "Poor")),
    strep_resistance = factor(strep_resistance, labels = c("Sensitive", "Moderate", "Resistant")),
    radiologic_6m = factor(radiologic_6m, labels = c("Death", "Considerable Deterioration", "Moderate Deterioration", "No Change", "Moderate Improvement", "Considerable Improvement")),
    baseline_cavitation = factor(baseline_cavitation, labels = c("Yes", "No")),
    gender = factor(gender, labels = c("Male", "Female"))
  )
```

```{r}
#Create summary table
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "This is a summary table."
tbl_summary(
  modified_data,
  by = gender,
  include = c(gender, arm, dose_strep_g, baseline_cavitation,
              improved,
              baseline_condition, strep_resistance, rad_num),
  label = list(
    arm ~ "Treatment",
    dose_strep_g ~ "Dose of Streptomycin (in grams)",
    baseline_condition ~ "Condition at Baseline",
    strep_resistance ~ "Resistance to Streptomycin at 6 months",
    baseline_cavitation ~ "Cavitation of Lungs at Baseline",
    improved ~ "Improved Outcome",
    rad_num ~ "Rating of Chest X-Ray at 6 months"
  ))
```

```{r}
#Regression

#| label: tbl-regression
#| tbl-cap: "These are regression results for whether patients improved or not. Improvement is categorized as binomial therefore the glm method was used in the regression model."

logistic_model <- glm(improved ~ gender*arm + baseline_condition + baseline_cavitation,
                      data = modified_data,
                      family = binomial ())

tbl_uvregression(
  modified_data,
  y = improved,
  include = c(gender, arm, dose_strep_g, baseline_cavitation,
              baseline_condition),
  label = list(
    gender ~ "Gender",
    arm ~ "Treatment",
    dose_strep_g ~ "Dose of Streptomycin (in grams)",
    baseline_condition ~ "Condition at Baseline",
    baseline_cavitation ~ "Cavitation of Lungs at Baseline"
  ),
  method = glm,
  method.args = list(family = binomial),
  exponentiate = T
)
```
In the figure created  below patients were categorized as "Sensitive" = 1, "Moderate" = 2, and "Resistant" = 3. 

```{r}
#Histogram
#| label: fig-histogram
#| fig-cap: "Histogram demonstrates Streptomycin resistance in patients"
hist(as.numeric(modified_data$strep_resistance),
     main = "Histogram of Streptomycin Resistance",
     xlab = "Resistance Level",
     breaks = 3)  # Set breaks to 3 since there are 3 levels
```

```{r}
#Function
new_table_function <- function(model) {
  tbl_regression(
    model,
    exponentiate = T,
    label = list(
      gender ~ "Gender",
      arm ~ "Treatment Group",
      baseline_condition ~ "Condition at Baseline",
      baseline_cavitation ~ "Cavitation of Lungs at Baseline"
    ))
}

logistic_model <- glm(improved ~ gender*arm + baseline_condition + baseline_cavitation,
                      data = modified_data,
                      family = binomial ())

new_table_function(logistic_model)
```
```{r}
#Inline R code pulling a statistic from a table (i.e., using gtsummary::inline_text())

total_sample <- nrow(modified_data)
```
There were `r total_sample` participants. 

```{r}
#Inline R code printing something else (like we did with the mean age in the example) (1 pt) and cross reference (1 pt)

stats <- list(n = nrow(modified_data),
              mean_rad_num = mean(modified_data$rad_num))
```
There were `r stats$n` participants with a mean chest x-ray rating of `r stats$mean_rad_num`.

@tbl-summary is a descriptive summary table.

@fig-histogram shows the distribution of streptomycin resistance.

This data is a collection of patients with TB. The data summarizes their treatment history, gender, baseline characteristics such as cavitation and condition and a scale of resistance to the treatment drug streptomycin at six months.
